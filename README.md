# Grocery-List Project

In this project with MERN, the user can add, edit and delete an item. The data is being saved in database.

## Instructions 

1-) Please open the client folder and run "npm install" for Frontend npm packages

2-) Then open grocery-list folder and run "npm install" for Backend npm packages

3-) Open grocery-list folder and run "npm run dev". With this command, both frontend and backend will run.

4-) I will send the relevant config.env file in the grocery-list folder in the attachment of my email.

5-) There is a file in client folder ".env". I added this file to be able to run my react project. Maybe you won"t need it. FYI
